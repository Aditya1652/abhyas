```

1. API Endpoints and Logic
   Authentication (/auth)

POST /signup: Create a new user account.
Integrate with Firebase Authentication.
Store user data in Firestore.
Optionally, generate a referral code for the user.
POST /login: Authenticate a user.
Generate and return a Firebase ID token.
POST /logout: Revoke the user's ID token.
User Management (/users)

GET /:userId: Get user details.
PUT /:userId: Update user profile.
DELETE /:userId: Delete a user account.
School Management (/schools)

POST /: Create a new school.
GET /:schoolId: Get school details.
PUT /:schoolId: Update school information.
DELETE /:schoolId: Delete a school.
POST /:schoolId/requests: Handle join requests (teachers/students).
Question Management (/questions)

POST /: Create a new question.
Award points/coins to the teacher.
GET /:questionId: Get question details.
PUT /:questionId: Update a question.
DELETE /:questionId: Delete a question.
Quiz Management (/quizzes)

POST /: Create a new quiz.
GET /:quizId: Get quiz details.
PUT /:quizId: Update a quiz.
DELETE /:quizId: Delete a quiz.
Exam Management (/exams)

POST /: Create a new exam.
GET /:examId: Get exam details.
PUT /:examId: Update an exam.
DELETE /:examId: Delete an exam.
POST /:examId/submit: Handle exam submission and marking.
Marketplace (/marketplace)

GET /questions: Search and filter questions.

POST /purchase: Handle purchase of questions/quizzes.
Payments (/payments)

POST /: Process payments using a payment gateway.
GET /subscriptions: Manage school subscriptions.
Rewards (/rewards)

GET /:userId: Get user's reward points/coins balance.
POST /:userId/referral: Award referral coins.
POST /:userId/ads: Award coins for watching ads.
Analytics (/analytics)

POST /event: Log custom events to Firebase Analytics.
GET /reports: Generate analytics reports (potentially using a third-party library). 3. Firebase Service Integration
Firestore:

Use the Firestore service (services/firestore.ts) to interact with Firestore for most data storage and retrieval.
Implement functions to create, read, update, and delete documents.
Use appropriate queries and transactions for data consistency.
Realtime Database:

Use the Realtime Database service (services/rtdb.ts) for real-time features like presence and live updates (if needed).
Authentication:

Use Firebase Authentication for user management and authentication.
Generate and verify Firebase ID tokens for secure API access.
App Check:

Implement App Check to protect your backend from abuse and unauthorized access.
Analytics:

Log custom events to Firebase Analytics to track user behavior and conversions.
Use the Analytics service (services/analytics.ts) to interact with Firebase Analytics.
Cloud Storage:

Use Cloud Storage to store images, files, or other media associated with questions, exams, or user profiles. 4. Additional Features
Rewards and Points:

Implement a reward system where teachers earn points/coins for contributing questions.
Award referral coins to users who refer others to the platform.
Integrate with an ad platform (e.g., AdMob) to reward users for watching ads.
Advertisement Integration:

Integrate with an ad platform to display ads in the application.
Implement logic to control ad frequency and placement.
Google Analytics:

Use Google Analytics to track user behavior, conversions, and other metrics.
Set up goals and funnels to track specific user actions.
Third-Party Integrations:

Integrate with other third-party services as needed (e.g., payment gateways, email providers, translation APIs). 5. Security
Implement Firebase Security Rules to protect your data and ensure authorized access.
Use App Check to prevent unauthorized access to your backend.
Validate all data received from clients to prevent malicious input.
Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, payment information) securely. 6. Deployment and Monitoring
Deploy your Firebase Functions to the appropriate region (e.g., asia-south1).
Use the Firebase console to monitor function performance, logs, and errors.
Set up alerts for critical errors or performance issues.
This detailed outline provides a roadmap for implementing your backend using Firebase Functions, integrating various Firebase services, and incorporating additional features to create a comprehensive and engaging exam portal application. Remember to adapt and refine this plan based on your specific requirements and priorities as you develop your application.
