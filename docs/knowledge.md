### Angular configs
These settings in the `angular.json` file are part of the build configuration for the production environment. Here's what each option does:

- optimization: Enables various optimizations like minification and tree-shaking to reduce the size of the output files.
- outputHashing: Adds a hash to the filenames of the output files, which helps with cache busting. The value "all" means that all files will have a hash.
- sourceMap: When set to false, source maps are not generated, which can improve build performance and reduce the size of the output files.
- extractCss: Extracts CSS into separate files instead of embedding it in the JavaScript bundles.
- namedChunks: When set to false, the chunks are not named, which can help with reducing the size of the output files.
- aot: Enables Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, which can improve the performance of the application by compiling the templates during the build process.
- extractLicenses: Extracts third-party licenses into a separate file.
- vendorChunk: When set to false, the vendor files are not separated into a different chunk, which can help with reducing the size of the output files.
- buildOptimizer: Enables Angular's build optimizer, which can further reduce the size of the output files by removing unnecessary code.
These settings are typically used to optimize the application for production deployment, ensuring that the output is as small and efficient as possible.
